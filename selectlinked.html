          >Whenever a model or part of a model consists of multiple elements it
          is commom to join (CTRL + J)<br />those elements together. This is
          being done for three main reasons:<br /><br />- Selecting multiple
          elements, which will likely be moved/transformed together anyway,
          faster.<br /><br />- Improving performance in large scenes.<br /><br />-
          Being able to set a single origin for all elements, which makes
          transformations more precise.<br /><br />After joining the mesh you
          obviously can't select the individual elements in Object Mode
          anymore,<br />
          but what if you need to access a specific element again? Blenders
          'Select Linked' function makes<br />this possible. Let's look at the
          following game asset, which consists of multiple elements and has<br />been
          joined into one mesh: </span
        ><br /><br />
        <img
          id="images"
          height="700px"
          src="bilder/selectlinked_01.png"
          alt="Joined mesh"
        />
        <p>A joined mesh (as indicated by the orange line around it).</p>
        <span class="mainText"
          >With the mesh still selected we switch into Object Mode (TAB). Using
          the 'Select Linked' function from here<br />is actually really simple:
          We just hover over the individual element, that we want to select, and
          press 'L'.
        </span>
        <img
          id="images"
          height="700px"
          src="bilder/selectlinked_02.png"
          alt="Specific element selected"
        />
        <span class="mainText"
          >As you can see it was possible to select the individual element.
          Additionally a window popped up in the<br>bottom left corner in which you
          can change the mode of the function, but for me the regular mode<br>(which
          calculates the selection based on the geometry, specifically the
          direction of the normals) has<br>worked in pretty much any case.
