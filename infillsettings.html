          >Per definition the infill describes the density of filament inside a
          printed 3D-model. This means that a<br />model with 100% infill will
          be completely solid, while a model with 0% infill will turn out to be
          hollow.<br />The infill-density greatly influences the overall print
          time and material usage, so it makes sense to optimize it.</span

        <span class="mainText"
          >The optimal density depends on the type of model you want to print. A
          model which is designed to be<br />hollow (a vase for example) will
          obvously be printed with 0% density. Apart from those types of
          models<br />I found an infill-density of around 20% to be optimal if
          the print will only be used for visual purpose. To<br />be more cost
          efficient that value can be reduced to 15% or even 10% while still
          being relatively sturdy.<br /><br />If the print has a functional
          purpose, like supporting weight, I would choose a density of at least
          30%-50%,<br />but keep in mind, that a density above 70% won't
          contribute much to the overall stability and will just<br />waste time
          and filament.<br /><br />In Cura you can change the infill-density
          with a slider, which is located in the top right corner when<br />opening
          the program.<br />After choosing your desired density and hitting the
          'Slice'-button another slider appears on the far right,<br />with
          which you can view the individual layers of your model and check if
          you've chosen the right<br />infill-value. Both sliders are marked red
          in the following picture for better understanding.
